Business Context:
We are in a time where businesses are more digitally advanced than ever, and as technology 
improves, organizations’ security postures must be enhanced as well. Failure to do so could result in 
a costly data breach, as we’ve seen happen with many businesses. The cybercrime landscape has 
evolved, and threat actors are going after any type of organization, so in order to protect your 
business’s data, money and reputation, it is critical that you invest in an advanced security system.
Cyber security can be described as the collective methods, technologies, and processes to help 
protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems, networks and data, 
against cyber-attacks or unauthorized access.
a. Information Security vs. Cyber Security vs. Network Security:
Information security (also known as InfoSec) ensures that both physical and digital data is protected 
from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or 
destruction. Information security differs from cyber security in that InfoSec aims to keep data in any 
form secure, whereas cyber security protects only digital data.
Cyber security, a subset of information security, is the practice of defending your organization’s 
networks, computers and data from unauthorized digital access, attack or damage by implementing 
various processes, technologies and practices. With the countless sophisticated threat actors 
targeting all types of organizations, it is critical that your IT infrastructure is secured at all times to 
prevent a full-scale attack on your network and risk exposing your company’ data and reputation.
Network security, a subset of cyber security, aims to protect any data that is being sent through 
devices in your network to ensure that the information is not changed or intercepted. The role of 
network security is to protect the organization’s IT infrastructure from all types of cyber threats 
including:
Viruses, worms and Trojan horses
a. Zero-day attacks
b. Hacker attacks
c. Denial of service attacks
d. Spyware and adware
Your network security team implements the hardware and software necessary to guard your 
security architecture. With the proper network security in place, your system can detect emerging 
threats before they infiltrate your network and compromise your data.
There are many components to a network security system that work together to improve your 
security posture. The most common network security components include:
a. Firewalls
b. Anti-virus software
c. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
d. Virtual private networks (VPN)
Network Intrusions vs. Computer intrusions vs. Cyber Attacks
1. Computer Intrusions:
Computer intrusions occur when someone tries to gain access to any part of your computer system. 
Computer intruders or hackers typically use automated computer programs when they try to 
compromise a computer’s security. There are several ways an intruder can try to gain access to your 
computer.
They can Access your 
a. Computer to view, change, or delete information on your computer, 
b. Crash or slow down your computer
c. Access your private data by examining the files on your system
d. Use your computer to access other computers on the Internet.
2. Network Intrusions:
A network intrusion refers to any unauthorized activity on a digital network. Network intrusions 
often involve stealing valuable network resources and almost always jeopardize the security of 
networks and/or their data. 
In order to proactively detect and respond to network intrusions, organizations and their cyber
security teams need to have a thorough understanding of how network intrusions work and 
implement network intrusion, detection, and response systems that are designed with attack 
techniques and cover-up methods in mind.
Network Intrusion Attack Techniques:
Given the amount of normal activity constantly taking place on digital networks, it can be very 
difficult to pinpoint anomalies that could indicate a network intrusion has occurred. Below are some 
of the most common network intrusion attack techniques that organizations should continually look 
for:
Living Off the Land: Attackers increasingly use existing tools and processes and stolen credentials 
when compromising networks. These tools like operating system utilities, business productivity 
software and scripting languages are clearly not malware and have very legitimate usage as well. In 
fact, in most cases, the vast majority of the usage is business justified, allowing an attacker to blend 
in.
Multi-Routing: If a network allows for asymmetric routing, attackers will often leverage multiple 
routes to access the targeted device or network. This allows them to avoid being detected by having 
a large portion of suspicious packets bypass certain network segments and any relevant network 
intrusion systems.
Buffer Overwriting: By overwriting certain sections of computer memory on a network device, 
attackers can replace normal data in those memory locations with a slew of commands that can 
later be used as part of a network intrusion. This attack technique is a lot harder to accomplish if 
boundary-checking logic is installed and executable code or malicious strings are identified before 
they can be written to the buffer.
Covert CGI Scripts: Unfortunately, the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), which allows servers to 
pass user requests to relevant applications and receive data back to then forward to users, serves as 
an easy opening for attackers to access network system files. For instance, if networks don’t require 
input verification or scan for backtracking, attackers can use a covert CGI script to add the directory 
label “..” or the pipe “|” character to any file path name, allowing them to access files that shouldn’t 
be accessible via the Web. Fortunately, CGI is much less popular today and there are far fewer 
devices that provide this interface.
Protocol-Specific Attacks: Protocols such as ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and various application 
protocols can inadvertently leave openings for network intrusions. Case in point: Attackers will often 
impersonate protocols or spoof protocol messages to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and thus 
access data they wouldn’t have access to otherwise, or to crash targeted devices on a network.
Traffic Flooding: By creating traffic loads that are too large for systems to adequately screen, 
attackers can induce chaos and congestion in network environments, which allows them to execute 
attacks without ever being detected.
Trojan Horse Malware: As the name suggests, Trojan Horse viruses create network backdoors that 
give attackers easy access to systems and any available data. Unlike other viruses and worms, 
Trojans don’t reproduce by infecting other files, and they don’t self-replicate. Trojans can be 
introduced from online archives and file repositories, and often originate from peer-to-peer file 
exchanges.
Worms: One of the easiest and most damaging network intrusion techniques is the common, 
standalone computer virus, or worm. Often spread through email attachments or instant messaging, 
worms take up large amounts of network resources, preventing the authorized activity from 
occurring. Some worms are designed to steal specific kinds of confidential information, such as 
financial information or any personal data relating to social security numbers, and they then relay 
that data to attackers waiting outside an organization’s network.
Network Intrusion Cover-Up Methods
Once attackers have employed common network intrusion attack techniques, they’ll often 
incorporate additional measures to cover their tracks and avoid detection. As mentioned above, 
using non-malware and living off the land tools have the dual advantage of being powerful while 
blending into business justified usage, thus making them hard to detect. In addition, below are three 
practices that are frequently used to circumvent cyber security teams and network intrusion 
detection systems:
Deleting logs: By deleting access logs, attackers can make it nearly impossible to determine where 
and what they’ve accessed (that is, without enlisting the help of an extensive cyber forensics team). 
Regularly scheduled log reviews and centralized logging can help combat this problem by preventing 
attackers from tampering with any type and/or location of logs.
Using encryption on departing data: Encrypting the data that’s being stolen from an organization’s 
network environment (or simply cloaking any outbound traffic so it looks normal) is one of the most 
straightforward tactics attackers can leverage to hide their movements from network-based 
detections.
Installing rootkits: Rootkits, or software that enables unauthorized users to gain control of a 
network without ever being detected, are particularly effective in covering attackers’ tracks, as they 
allow attackers to leisurely inspect systems and exploit them over long periods of time.
3. Cyber Attack:
A cyber-attack is any type of offensive action that targets computer information systems, 
infrastructures, computer networks or personal computer devices, using various methods to steal, 
alter or destroy data or information systems.
Common cyber-attack types:
a. Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
b. Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack
c. Phishing and spear phishing attacks
d. Drive-by attack
e. Password attack
f. SQL injection attack
g. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
h. Eavesdropping attack
i. Birthday attack
j. Malware attack
Business Objective:
With the enormous growth of computer networks usage and the huge increase in the number of 
applications running on top of it, network security is becoming increasingly more important. All the 
computer systems suffer from security vulnerabilities which are both technically difficult and 
economically costly to be solved by the manufacturers. Therefore, the role of Intrusion Detection 
Systems (IDSs), as special-purpose devices to detect anomalies and attacks in the network, is 
becoming more important. 
The research in the intrusion detection field has been mostly focused on anomaly-based and misusebased detection techniques for a long time. While misuse-based detection is generally favoured in 
commercial products due to its predictability and high accuracy, in academic research anomaly 
detection is typically conceived as a more powerful method due to its theoretical potential for 
addressing novel attacks.
As part of this project, your task is to build network intrusion detection system to detect anomalies 
and attacks in the network.
There are two problems:
Binomial classification: Detect anomalies by predicting Activity is normal or attack
Multinomial Classification: Detecting type of activity by predicting Activity is Normal or Back or 
Buffer Over flow or FTP Write or Guess Password or Neptune or N-Map or Port Sweep or Root Kit or 
Satan or Smurf.
Hints about Data: Different attack data set have different number of observations. This data is an 
example of imbalance data.
Data Preparation:
You are required to append all the files and create new column called attack based on the name of 
attack. While you are appending the files, you can take resampling of data based on the number of 
attacks.
For Binomial classification, you can create attack variable with attack vs. normal
For Multinomial classification, you can create attack variable with normal vs. Back vs. Buffer Over 
flow vs. FTP Write vs. Guess Password vs. Neptune vs. N-Map vs. Port Sweep vs. Root Kit vs. 
Satan vs. Smurf.
